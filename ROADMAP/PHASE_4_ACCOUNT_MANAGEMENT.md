### 🚨 CRITICAL: GDPR Compliance Requirements

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before production launch, complete GDPR data removal process:

#### Required for GDPR Compliance:
1. **Data Inventory**
   - [ ] Document all customer data stored (database, files, logs, backups)
   - [ ] Map data dependencies (claims, files, notes, status history)
   - [ ] Identify third-party data processors (email service, file storage)

2. **Data Deletion Process**
   - [ ] Create admin workflow to manually delete customer data
   - [ ] Delete/anonymize all customer claims
   - [ ] Delete uploaded files from Nextcloud
   - [ ] Remove from email marketing lists
   - [ ] Anonymize audit logs (replace customer_id with "DELETED_USER")
   - [ ] Document deletion process in admin guide

3. **Data Retention Policy**
   - [ ] Define retention periods for different data types
   - [ ] Keep financial records for 7 years (legal requirement)
   - [ ] Anonymize vs. delete decision tree

4. **Right to Data Portability**
   - [ ] `GET /account/export-data` - Export all customer data as JSON/PDF
   - [ ] Include claims, files metadata, account history
   - [ ] GDPR Article 20 compliance

5. **Privacy Policy & Terms**
   - [ ] Update privacy policy with data deletion process
   - [ ] Document 30-day deletion window
   - [ ] Explain data retention for legal compliance

#### 4.6 Cookie Consent & GDPR Compliance 🍪 **CONDITIONAL**

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Only required if we implement client-side tracking
**Status**: ⏸️ **DEFERRED** - Not needed until analytics with cookies are implemented
**Regulation**: GDPR Article 7 (Consent), ePrivacy Directive
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-29

**Current Assessment**:
We currently use ONLY strictly necessary cookies (JWT authentication: `access_token`, `refresh_token`). These do NOT require user consent under GDPR Article 6(1)(b) and ePrivacy Directive Recital 25.

**When Cookie Consent IS Required**:
- If we add Google Analytics (client-side tracking cookies)
- If we add marketing/retargeting cookies
- If we add any non-essential tracking

**When Cookie Consent is NOT Required** ✅:
- Strictly necessary authentication cookies (current setup)
- Server-side analytics (no cookies)
- Cookieless analytics (Plausible, Fathom, Simple Analytics)

**Overview**:
A cookie consent banner is only legally required when we store non-essential cookies. Our JWT authentication cookies are strictly necessary for the service to function and are exempt from consent requirements. We must still DISCLOSE these cookies in our Privacy Policy (Phase 4.7), but we don't need an interactive consent banner unless we add optional tracking.

**Regulatory Requirements**:
- **GDPR Article 7**: Explicit consent required for non-essential cookies
- **ePrivacy Directive**: Consent required before storing cookies (except strictly necessary)
- **GDPR Recital 32**: Pre-ticked boxes are NOT valid consent
- **Penalties**: Up to €20M or 4% of global annual revenue

**Cookie Classification**:
1. **Strictly Necessary** (No consent required):
   - Session cookies for authenticated users
   - Load balancer cookies
   - Security/fraud prevention cookies

2. **Functionality Cookies** (Consent required):
   - User preference storage (theme, language)
   - Form data persistence

3. **Analytics Cookies** (Consent required):
   - Google Analytics or similar (if implemented)

**JWT Authentication Cookies**:
- **Classification**: Strictly necessary (authentication is core functionality)
- **Consent**: NOT required for authentication cookies (they're essential)
- **Transparency**: MUST still disclose in cookie banner and privacy policy
- **Justification**: Article 6(1)(b) - necessary for contract performance

**Tasks**:

**Frontend Implementation**:
- [ ] Choose cookie consent library
  - **Option A**: Cookie Consent by Osano (free, GDPR-compliant)
  - **Option B**: CookieYes (free tier available)
  - **Option C**: Custom implementation (more work, full control)
- [ ] Implement cookie consent banner UI
  - [ ] Show banner on first visit (before setting any non-essential cookies)
  - [ ] Must have "Accept All" and "Reject All" buttons
  - [ ] Must have "Cookie Settings" for granular control
  - [ ] Banner must be closable after choice
  - [ ] Store consent choice in localStorage or cookie
- [ ] Add cookie settings modal/page
  - [ ] List all cookie categories with descriptions
  - [ ] Toggle switches for each category (strictly necessary should be disabled/always on)
  - [ ] Save preferences button
  - [ ] Link to privacy policy
- [ ] Implement consent enforcement
  - [ ] Only load analytics scripts if user consented
  - [ ] Only set non-essential cookies if user consented
  - [ ] Authentication cookies can be set (strictly necessary)
- [ ] Add "Cookie Settings" link in footer
- [ ] Respect user preferences across sessions

**Backend Configuration**:
- [ ] Categorize all cookies in use
  - [ ] `auth_token` - Strictly necessary (JWT access token)
  - [ ] `refresh_token` - Strictly necessary (JWT refresh token)
  - [ ] Any other application cookies
- [ ] Add cookie policy endpoint `GET /legal/cookies`
  - [ ] Return JSON with all cookie details (name, purpose, duration, type)
  - [ ] Used to populate cookie consent UI

**Legal Documentation**:
- [ ] Create Cookie Policy page (`/legal/cookies`)
  - [ ] List all cookies with: name, purpose, duration, type
  - [ ] Explain strictly necessary vs optional cookies
  - [ ] Link to privacy policy
- [ ] Update Privacy Policy
  - [ ] Add section on cookies and tracking
  - [ ] Explain how to manage cookie preferences
  - [ ] Link to cookie policy
  - [ ] Explain data collected via cookies
- [ ] Add "Cookies" section to terms of service

**Geolocation**:
- [ ] Detect EU visitors (optional but recommended)
  - [ ] Use IP geolocation API (ipapi.co, ip-api.com)
  - [ ] Only show banner to EU visitors
  - [ ] Or show to all visitors (safer approach)
- [ ] Consider showing simplified banner to non-EU visitors

**Testing**:
- [ ] Test banner shows on first visit
- [ ] Test banner doesn't show after consent given
- [ ] Test "Accept All" sets all cookies
- [ ] Test "Reject All" only sets strictly necessary cookies
- [ ] Test cookie settings modal works
- [ ] Test preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Test authentication works with minimal cookies (reject all)
- [ ] Test analytics don't load if rejected
- [ ] Test "Change Cookie Settings" link in footer

   - [ ] Auto-reply confirmation email
   - [ ] Link from footer and header navigation

**Implementation Details**:

**Frontend**:
- Create pages in `frontend_Claude45/src/pages/Legal/`
  - `TermsOfService.tsx`
  - `PrivacyPolicy.tsx`
  - `ContactPage.tsx`
- Add routes to `App.tsx`
- Update footer component with links

- **Support**: Contact page provides customer support channel

#### 4.8 Analytics & Tracking Strategy 📊 **DECISION NEEDED**

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Valuable for growth but not blocking launch
**Status**: 📋 **PLANNING** - Need to decide what to track and how
**Estimated Effort**: 1-3 days (depending on approach chosen)
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-29

**Overview**:
Determine what user behavior and business metrics we want to track, and choose a privacy-respecting implementation approach. The key question: What analytics provide business value without compromising user privacy or requiring cookie consent?

---

### What Could We Track? (Business Value Assessment)

#### 1. Conversion Funnel 🎯 **HIGH VALUE**

**Goal**: Identify where users abandon the claim submission process

**Track**:
- Homepage → Eligibility check: How many start?
- Eligibility check → Claim form: How many qualify and continue?
- Claim form → Document upload: Where do they drop off?
- Document upload → Submit: Do file uploads cause abandonment?

**Business Impact**:
- If 50% drop off at document upload → simplify that step
- If 80% abandon at eligibility check → improve messaging
- **ROI**: Increasing conversion by 10% = 10% more revenue
- **Implementation**: Easy - add event tracking in backend

**Example**:
```python
await analytics.track_event("claim_flow_step", {
    "step": "eligibility_check_started",
    "user_type": "anonymous",
    "flight_distance_km": 1500
})
```

#### 2. Traffic Sources 📈 **HIGH VALUE**

**Goal**: Know which marketing channels actually work

**Track**:
- Organic search vs paid ads vs referrals
- Which keywords bring paying customers?
- Social media effectiveness
- Referral program performance (future)

**Business Impact**:
- Stop wasting money on ads that don't convert
- Double down on channels that work
- Measure marketing ROI accurately
- **ROI**: Could cut marketing costs by 30-50%

**Implementation**: Server-side referrer tracking or Plausible

#### 3. User Behavior Patterns 🔍 **MEDIUM VALUE**

**Goal**: Understand how people actually use the site

**Track**:
- Which pages get viewed most?
- How long do users spend on the claim form?
- Do they read the FAQ before submitting?
- Mobile vs desktop usage
- Browser compatibility

**Business Impact**:
- Optimize page layout based on actual behavior
- Identify confusing UI elements
- Prioritize mobile vs desktop development
- **ROI**: Moderate - improves UX incrementally

**Implementation**: Page view tracking (server-side or Plausible)

#### 4. Technical Issues 🐛 **HIGH VALUE**

**Goal**: Catch errors affecting conversions before users complain

**Track**:
- JavaScript errors in browser console
- Failed API calls (4xx, 5xx errors)
- Slow page load times
- Browser/device compatibility issues
- File upload failures

**Business Impact**:
- Fix bugs proactively
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Reduce support tickets
- **ROI**: High - every bug fix increases conversions

**Implementation**: Error logging (Sentry) + performance monitoring

#### 5. Business Metrics 💰 **CRITICAL VALUE**

**Goal**: Understand revenue and claim success rates

**Track**:
- Claims submitted per day/week/month
- Claim approval rate by airline
- Average compensation amount
- Time to process claims
- Customer lifetime value

**Business Impact**:
- Investor reporting
- Identify best/worst airlines to target
- Forecast revenue
- **ROI**: Critical for business operations

**Implementation**: Backend database queries + dashboard (no external tracking needed)

---

### What We DON'T Need to Track (Low/No Value)

❌ **Individual user browsing history** - Creepy, no business value, privacy violation
❌ **Demographics beyond what they tell us** - Not useful for B2C flight claims
❌ **Cross-site tracking** - Irrelevant for single-purpose platform
❌ **Social media integration tracking** - Overkill for your use case
❌ **Session recordings** - Invasive, limited value for transactional site
❌ **Heatmaps** - Nice-to-have, not critical for claims platform

---

### Implementation Options (Privacy-Respecting)

#### Option 1: Server-Side Event Tracking ✅ **RECOMMENDED - START HERE**

**What it is**: Track events in your backend code as users perform actions

**Advantages**:
- ✅ NO cookie consent needed (no client-side cookies)
- ✅ GDPR compliant by default (no PII unless you log it)
- ✅ Ad-blocker proof (server-side)
- ✅ Complete control over what's tracked
- ✅ Free (just database storage)
- ✅ Can implement TODAY

**What you track**:
```python
# app/services/analytics_service.py
async def track_event(event_name: str, properties: dict):
    """Track business events server-side"""
    event = AnalyticsEvent(
        event_name=event_name,
        properties=properties,
        timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
        # NO user identification unless authenticated
        user_id=current_user.id if authenticated else None,
        session_id=request.cookies.get("session_id"),  # Anonymous session
        ip_country=get_country_from_ip(request.client.host),
        user_agent=request.headers.get("user-agent")
    )
    await db.save(event)

# Usage throughout application
await track_event("claim_submitted", {
    "airline": "Lufthansa",
    "flight_distance_km": 1500,
    "compensation_tier": "400_euro",
    "incident_type": "delay"
})

await track_event("file_uploaded", {
    "document_type": "boarding_pass",
    "file_size_kb": 250,
    "mime_type": "application/pdf"
})

await track_event("claim_form_abandoned", {
    "last_step": "passenger_details",
    "time_spent_seconds": 120
})
```

**Cost**: Free (just database storage)
**Effort**: 1-2 days to implement
**Privacy**: Excellent - you control everything
**GDPR**: No consent needed (just disclose in Privacy Policy)

**Database Schema**:
```python
class AnalyticsEvent(Base):
    __tablename__ = "analytics_events"

    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    event_name = Column(String(100), nullable=False, index=True)
    properties = Column(JSON, nullable=True)

    # Context (anonymous unless authenticated)
    user_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("customers.id"), nullable=True)
    session_id = Column(String(100), nullable=True, index=True)
    ip_country = Column(String(2), nullable=True)  # Just country code, not full IP
    user_agent = Column(Text, nullable=True)

    timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False, index=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
```

**Then build simple analytics dashboard**:
```python
# app/routers/admin_analytics.py
@router.get("/admin/analytics/conversion-funnel")
async def get_conversion_funnel(session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    """Show claim submission funnel"""

    # Count events by step
    steps = [
        "eligibility_check_started",
        "claim_form_started",
        "documents_uploaded",
        "claim_submitted"
    ]

    funnel = {}
    for step in steps:
        count = await session.execute(
            select(func.count(AnalyticsEvent.id))
            .where(AnalyticsEvent.event_name == step)
            .where(AnalyticsEvent.timestamp >= datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30))
        )
        funnel[step] = count.scalar()

    return funnel
    # Returns: {
    #   "eligibility_check_started": 1000,
    #   "claim_form_started": 600,  # 40% drop-off
    #   "documents_uploaded": 450,   # 25% drop-off
    #   "claim_submitted": 400       # 11% drop-off
    # }
```

---

#### Option 2: Plausible Analytics ✅ **RECOMMENDED - ADD AFTER OPTION 1**

**What it is**: Privacy-focused, cookieless analytics service (like Google Analytics but GDPR-friendly)

**Advantages**:
- ✅ NO cookie consent needed (cookieless tracking)
- ✅ GDPR compliant by default (EU-based, no PII)
- ✅ Ad-blocker resistant (respects DNT but not blocked like Google)
- ✅ Beautiful dashboard (easy to share with investors/team)
- ✅ 2-minute setup (one script tag)
- ✅ Lightweight (< 1KB script)
- ✅ Open source (can self-host)

**What you get**:
- Page views and unique visitors
- Traffic sources (referrers, UTM campaigns)
- Top pages and entry/exit pages
- Countries and devices
- Custom events (button clicks, form submissions)
- Real-time dashboard

**Cost**:
- Hosted: $9/month (up to 10k monthly pageviews)
- Self-hosted: Free (requires server setup)

**Setup**:
```html
<!-- In frontend_Claude45/public/index.html -->
<script defer
        data-domain="eac.dvvcloud.work"
        src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js">
</script>
```

**Custom events** (track conversions):
```typescript
// In frontend
plausible('Claim Submitted', {
  props: {
    airline: 'Lufthansa',
    compensation: '400'
  }
});
```

**Effort**: 2 minutes (hosted) or 2 hours (self-hosted)
**Privacy**: Excellent - no cookies, no PII, GDPR-compliant
**GDPR**: No consent needed

**Comparison to Google Analytics**:
| Feature | Plausible | Google Analytics |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Cookie consent | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Required |
| Ad-blocker proof | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Blocked |
| Privacy-friendly | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Setup complexity | ✅ 2 minutes | ⚠️ 30 minutes |
| Cost | $9/month | Free |
| Data ownership | ✅ Yours | ❌ Google's |

**Website**: https://plausible.io

---

#### Option 4: Google Analytics 4 (Privacy Mode) ⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED**

**What it is**: Google's analytics platform with privacy settings enabled

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Powerful features
- ✅ Familiar to everyone
- ⚠️ Can be configured for cookieless tracking

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ STILL requires consent in EU (sends data to Google)
- ❌ Ad-blockers block it (40-60% of traffic lost)
- ❌ Privacy concerns (Google owns your data)
- ❌ Overkill for your use case
- ❌ Slower (large script)

**Verdict**: **Not recommended** for EasyAirClaim - privacy concerns and ad-blocking make it less effective than alternatives

#### Option 5: Error Tracking (Sentry) 🐛 **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**What it is**: Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring

**What you get**:
- JavaScript errors in user browsers
- Backend exceptions and crashes
- API response times
- Stack traces with context
- User impact analysis
- Alerting when errors spike

**Advantages**:
- ✅ NO cookie consent needed (just error monitoring)
- ✅ Catches bugs before users report them
- ✅ Shows exactly what went wrong
- ✅ Free tier: 5k errors/month

**Cost**:
- Free tier: 5,000 errors/month
- Paid: $26/month (50k errors/month)

**Setup**:
```python
# Backend
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your-dsn", traces_sample_rate=0.1)
```

```typescript
// Frontend
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
Sentry.init({ dsn: "your-dsn" });
```

**Effort**: 1 hour
**Privacy**: Good - only captures errors, not behavior
**GDPR**: No consent needed (error monitoring is legitimate interest)

**Website**: https://sentry.io

1. ✅ **Server-side event tracking** (Option 1)
   - Track conversion funnel steps
   - Track business metrics (claims submitted, approved, etc.)
   - Track technical errors
   - Build simple admin dashboard
   - **Effort**: 1-2 days
   - **Cost**: Free

2. ✅ **Sentry error tracking** (Option 5)
   - Catch frontend and backend errors
   - Performance monitoring
   - **Effort**: 1 hour
   - **Cost**: Free tier

**Phase 2: After 100+ Users (Month 2)** - Still No Consent Needed
3. ✅ **Add Plausible Analytics** (Option 2)
   - Beautiful traffic dashboard
   - Traffic source analysis
   - Professional reporting for investors
   - **Effort**: 5 minutes
   - **Cost**: $9/month

**Phase 3: Future (Month 6+)** - If Needed
4. ⚠️ **Consider cookie consent** (Phase 4.6) ONLY if you want:
   - User-specific tracking across sessions
   - Remarketing/advertising cookies
   - Third-party marketing integrations

### What We Need to Decide

**Decision Matrix**:

| Question | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Track conversion funnel?** | Yes / No | ✅ YES - High ROI, implement server-side |
| **Track traffic sources?** | Plausible / Umami / Google / None | ✅ Plausible ($9/mo) or Umami (free) |
| **Track errors?** | Sentry / Custom / None | ✅ Sentry (free tier) |
| **Track business metrics?** | Yes / No | ✅ YES - Already in database, add dashboard |
| **Need cookie consent?** | Yes / No | ❌ NO - If using recommended options |

**Next Steps**:
1. [ ] **Decide**: Which metrics are most valuable for the business?
2. [ ] **Choose**: Plausible ($9/mo) or Umami (free, self-hosted)?
3. [ ] **Implement**: Start with server-side tracking (1-2 days)
4. [ ] **Add**: Error tracking with Sentry (1 hour)
5. [ ] **Update**: Privacy Policy to disclose analytics (Phase 4.7)

**Budget Impact**:
- **Option A** (Free): Server-side + Umami + Sentry free tier = $0/month
- **Option B** (Paid): Server-side + Plausible + Sentry free tier = $9/month
- **Option C** (Full): Server-side + Plausible + Sentry paid = $35/month

**Privacy Impact**:
- All recommended options: NO cookie consent banner needed ✅
- Just disclose in Privacy Policy: "We use cookieless analytics to improve our service"

### Success Criteria

After implementing analytics, we should be able to answer:
- ✅ How many people start vs complete claims? (conversion rate)
- ✅ Where do users drop off in the funnel? (optimization targets)
- ✅ Which marketing channels drive the most claims? (ROI)
- ✅ What errors are users encountering? (bug priorities)
- ✅ How many claims are approved vs rejected by airline? (business intelligence)
- ✅ What's the average claim value? (revenue forecasting)

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test email change workflow with verification
- [ ] Test password change and token invalidation
- [ ] Test account deletion request flow
- [ ] Test blacklist prevents login
- [ ] Test admin can view and process deletion requests
- [ ] Test GDPR data export

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Customers can change their email and password
- ✅ Account deletion requests are tracked and require admin approval
- ✅ Blacklisted emails cannot log in
- ✅ Admins receive notification of deletion requests
- ✅ Customer data can be exported for GDPR compliance
- ✅ Clear manual process documented for data deletion
- ✅ Privacy policy updated with deletion process

### Notes

**Why manual deletion approval?**
- Allows admin to verify no open claims/disputes
- Ensures financial records are properly archived
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Complies with legal retention requirements

**Blacklist approach:**
- Immediate effect (user can't login)
- Preserves data temporarily for admin review
- Allows cancellation of deletion request
- Gives time to close open claims
