# US-First Launch Strategy: Legal Re-Assessment

## 🎯 Strategic Pivot: US Market Only
Since the initial launch is targeted **exclusively at the US market**, the legal requirements shift significantly. The rigorous EU/German requirements (Imprint, strict GDPR local representation) become lower priority or irrelevant for now.

## ✅ What is "Good to Go"
1.  **Imprint (Impressum):**
    *   **Status:** 🟢 **Not Required.**
    *   **Reason:** The US has no equivalent to the German *Impressum* obligation. As long as you don't explicitly target German/EU consumers (e.g., via .de domains or German language ads), you can skip this.

2.  **Terms & Conditions:**
    *   **Status:** 🟢 **Strong.**
    *   **Reason:** Your existing "Florida Law," "Class Action Waiver," and "Arbitration" clauses are standard and enforceable in the US. They provide excellent protection for the company.
    *   *Note:* Do **not** water these down with EU consumer protections yet.

3.  **Privacy Policy:**
    *   **Status:** 🟢 **Compliant.**
    *   **Reason:** You already have a dedicated **CCPA (California)** section. This is the gold standard for US privacy compliance.

## ⚠️ Recommended "Quick Fix" for US Launch
To reinforce your "US-Only" legal stance and prevent accidental EU jurisdiction application:

### 1. Add a "Geographic Scope" Disclaimer
Add this to **Section 2 (Services Provided)** or **Section 1 (Introduction)** of your Terms:

> **"Geographic Scope:** The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations."

### 2. GDPR Reality Check
*   **Even for US Launch:** You are processing "EU261 Claims". This means you are sending data to **European Airlines**.
*   **Data Transfer:** Your Privacy Policy's section on "International Data Transfers" is still vital (and currently good).
*   **Risk:** Low. US consumers filing claims for flights to Europe are generally subject to US terms for their relationship *with you*.

## 📉 De-Prioritized Items (Ignore for now)
*   **EU Representative (Art 27 GDPR):** Can be postponed until you actively market to EU residents.
*   **German Imprint:** Ignore.
*   **EU Consumer Law Overrides:** Ignore.

## 🏁 Verdict
**You are legally ready for a US launch.**
The "Critical" flags raised in the previous analysis were based on the assumption of a global/EU launch (given the nature of EU261). For a US-only scope, you are safe.
